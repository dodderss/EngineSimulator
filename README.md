# Engine Designer

Engine Designer is a powerful and intuitive web application built with React that allows users to design and simulate engines. By entering various parameters such as bore, stroke, compression ratio, turbo information, and RPM limit, users can get detailed outputs including power, torque, efficiency, weight, and price.

## Features

- **Parameter Input:** Enter detailed engine parameters including bore, stroke, compression ratio, turbo info, and RPM limit.
- **Real-time Calculation:** Get instant feedback on power, torque, efficiency, weight, and price as you modify parameters.
- **Responsive Design:** User interface adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scrollable Statistics:** Keep track of key statistics with a dedicated scrollable section for easy navigation on smaller screens.
